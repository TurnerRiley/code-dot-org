Check your technology and decide if you need to troubleshoot anything in advance of your Hour of Code.\r\n- Review the supplementary lesson plan, [\"The Big Dance Party\"](https://curriculum.code.org/hoc/unplugged/4/) to determine whether or not you'd like to lead this lesson in advance of your Hour of Code.\r\n\r\n### One Day Before Your Hour of Code\r\n\r\n- Each student who completes the activity should receive a certificate. [Print one](http://code.org/certificates) for everyone in advance to make this easier at the end of your Hour of Code.\r\n- (optional) Encourage students to bring in headphones to use during the activity.",
