With this system, we can purchase large items on loan like cars or houses, which would be out of reach for many people if they had to pay outright. *Harms:* Decisions made are not always fair or equitable.

Equifax's customers are businesses who want to use that data to make decisions about people. Private citizens' data was and is constantly being collected - and potentially hacked.

The first one we are going to talk about is multifactor authentication.  |\n|![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-10---Cybersecurity-and-Global-Impacts1.svg){: style=\"border:1px solid black\"} |**Say:** When we discussed passwords in the Warm Up, this was an example of single factor authentication. There is one layer of protection, that is centered around something you know: your password. <br><br> ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/animation.png) **Click through animation** |\n|![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-10---Cybersecurity-and-Global-Impacts2.svg){: style=\"border:1px solid black\"} |**Say:** Two factor authentication adds another layer. <br><br> **Prompt** What do you think is another way of protecting your data? <br><br> ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/animation.png) **Click through animation** <br><br> **Say:** In addition to something you know, another layer is something you possess like a phone. Have you ever been required to put a phone number in when getting a password authenticated? Sometimes a text will be sent to your phone with a code to enter in, proving that you are the person who has the phone. This layer means someone who just guesses your password can't get in to your account - they would also need access to your phone. |\n|![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-10---Cybersecurity-and-Global-Impacts3.svg){: style=\"border:1px solid black\"} |**Prompt:** What are the problems with this system? How could it be hacked? <br><br> **Goal:** Guide the discussion towards the answer that a phone could be stolen or a sim card lost. |\n|![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-10---Cybersecurity-and-Global-Impacts4.svg){: style=\"border:1px solid black\"} |**Prompt:** There's another layer that can be used to protect your data. Can anyone guess what it is? <br><br> ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/animation.png) **Click through animation** <br><br> **Say:** If you guessed something physical or perhaps \"biometrics\", you are correct! <br><br>![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/animation.png) **Click through animation** <br><br> A fingerprint is an example of this. A retina scan of your eye is another example. These three options: something you know, something you possess, and something you are make up multifactor authentication, which involves at least two of these options and preferably all three. If someone tried to access your account, they would be required to know your password, have access to your phone and your fingerprint! |\n|![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-10---Cybersecurity-and-Global-Impacts5.svg){: style=\"border:1px solid black\"} |**Prompt:** Why is this better than Single Factor Authentication? What are the challenges with the system? Is it worth any of the risks? <br><br> **Note:** Allow students time to think through these prompts, perhaps in small groups before having a whole class discussion. Multifactor authentication can keep data more protected than single factor authentication, but it requires extra steps which add time and often money (the cost of a phone, etc.). There are also privacy concerns with having your fingerprints or retina scanned. |\n|![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-10---Cybersecurity-and-Global-Impacts6.svg){: style=\"border:1px solid black\"} |**Say:** Another way to protect your data involves updating your software. | \n|![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-10---Cybersecurity-and-Global-Impacts7.svg){: style=\"border:1px solid black\"} |**Say:** Let's review. What is a virus? <br><br> **Note:** Give students an opportunity to glance through the notes and review computer viruses from lesson 7. |\n|![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-10---Cybersecurity-and-Global-Impacts8.svg){: style=\"border:1px solid black\"} |**Say:** Do you remember how to protect your device from a computer virus? <br><br> **Note:** Allow students to suggest different forms of protection before clicking through the animation. <br><br> ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/animation.png) **Click through animation** <br><br> **Say:** Two things you can do: use virus scanning software and update system software. You could also say, keep all software updated! |\n|![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-10---Cybersecurity-and-Global-Impacts9.svg){: style=\"border:1px solid black\"} |**Say:** Data protection is a moving target. It's not a one and done process. It's not enough to install virus protection software and never thing about it again! New viruses and threats are constantly being developed - you need to keep your software up to date and use the best authentication practices you can in order to keep your data safe! |",

In particular, students may not receive a grade based on performance on topic questions nor can they be used for teacher evaluation. Beyond these requirements, however, they are primarily intended to formatively assess student progress and learning as they prepare for the end of course exam.\r\n\r\nWithin our own course we recommend that you use them in a variety of ways:\r\n\r\n* Throughout the unit assign topic questions to students related to the topics students are learning about that day or that week\r\n* Prior to the unit assessment assign topic questions to help students practice and prepare for the summative assessment\r\n* After the unit assessment use these topic questions to help students track their progress towards preparation for the AP assessment\r\n\r\n![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/topics10.png)\r\n\r\nClick for more info: [Code.org CSP Topic Coverage](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dqYF5u0AULjw049gaCwAP34ZSe0VuEWbAjWoH1-YMW0/edit?usp=sharing)\r\n\r\n"
