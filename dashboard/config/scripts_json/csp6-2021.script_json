In the first students answer a series of questions about birthdates and names of their classmates. They then discuss the similarities and differences between the problems. In the second activity students are given six different algorithms and must analyze them to determine which they think are the same or different. At the end of the lesson they are introduced to the formal definitions of a problem and an algorithm.",

        "purpose": "This lesson is an approachable and interactive introduction to the main concepts of this short unit. Students have been writing a lot of code, and now they are ready to think on a high level about the patterns that make two different problems, or two different algorithms, similar or different. This mindset will be important as they tackle the more challenging material later in the unit where students will learn to compare different algorithms that address the same problem.",

        "purpose": "In the previous lesson students learned that there are many different ways to write an algorithm to solve a problem. However, not all solutions are good options, and some algorithms require many fewer steps to run than others. This lesson focuses on comparing Linear Search to Binary Search. The the length of the list being searched, the more efficient Binary Search is compared to Linear Search. That sai,d Binary Search has a constraint: the list must first be sorted. This lesson more broadly introduces students to thinking about the efficiency of an algorithm, an idea that will be explored more in future lessons.",

You only need to keep track of the closest birthday you've heard so far, however.\n* Problem 5 is easy to solve as soon as you've solved problems 3 and 4.\n* Problem 6 - 10 require you to have written down everyone's birthday, likely in order.\n* Problems 7 - 9 are the same problem but for different numbers of people.

For this one it's very easy to just yell out what number you would pair with and lose the opporuntity to see how many total checks are necessary if they can just all yell from their seats.\r\n* The group raffle doesn't necessarily need to be silent. As students will see, it's an incredibly difficult problem and they're going to need to do a lot of checking even if they're able to talk out loud.\r\n* Think ahead about whether you actually want to award winners of the raffles. It's pretty unlikely that there will be a winner. \r\n* There's a pretty good chance that no one will win either raffle.\r\n"

Read through the rules together as a class. <br><br>**Rules:**<br><ul><li>You must start and end at your own house.</li><li>You can only visit each house once.</li></ul><br><br>**Discuss:** Students share their paths with a partner before discussing as a class. |\r\n|![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-6---Algorithms2.svg){: style=\"border:1px solid black\"} | **Say:** Take a look at some of these paths on the screen. You may have similar ones in your journal. <br><br> **Prompt:** What do you need to know to determine the best path?   |\r\n|![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-6---Algorithms3.svg){: style=\"border:1px solid black\"} | **Say:** Distance! If we know the distance between each house, we can make a better decision about which path to take. In this example, the first option is shortest, so that's the path we would choose. |\r\n|![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-6---Algorithms4.svg){: style=\"border:1px solid black\"} | **Prompt:** What if we had a lot more places to visit? How would we determine the best path? <br><br> **Discussion Goal:** The goal here is for students to come to the realization that they would need to explore all possible paths in order to determine which one is the best.   |\r\n|![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-6---Algorithms5.svg){: style=\"border:1px solid black\"} | **Say:** This is known as the Traveling Salesman Problem. For each new place to visit, the number of options for possible paths increases factorialy.  |\r\n|![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-6---Algorithms6.svg){: style=\"border:1px solid black\"} | **Say:** A factorial function is written with the letter \"n\" followed by an explanation point. Here's how n! works: Multiply all whole numbers from the given number down to the number 1.<br><br>**Note:** Talk through the examples and the table. The goal here isn't for students to memorize the math, but to understand that with each new house added, the number of potential paths that have to be checked expands very quickly.  | \r\n|![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-6---AlgorithmsDecisions.svg){: style=\"border:1px solid black\"} | **Say:** The Traveling Salesman is an Optimization Problem. It's not a Decision Problem. We know there is a path. Now we must determine which is the shortest or most efficient path. |\r\n|![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-6---Algorithms7.svg){: style=\"border:1px solid black\"} | **Say:** The Traveling Salesman Problem can be solved with an algorithm, which checks each possible option. <br><br> BUT, it would take massive amounts of computing power to compare every single option, especially as the number of homes to visit (otherwise known as nodes) increases. <br><br> Therefore, it would take an **unreasonable** amount of time for the solution to be calculated for most instances of the problem. \r\n|![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-6---Algorithms8.svg){: style=\"border:1px solid black\"} | **Say:** Welcome to **heuristics**! Heuristics provide a good enough solution to a problem when an actual solution is impractical or impossible. |\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n[slide] **Do This:** Students now navigate to Level 2 on Code Studio where they will use the Traveling Salesman Widget to find the \"best\" path to visit all nodes. \r\n\r\n* In their journal, students should write down a plan or **heuristic** for choosing a good path. \r\n\r\n**Discuss:** In pairs, students should share their heuristics and make adjustments to their own as needed. \r\n\r\n[slide] **Do This:** Now students navigate to Level 3 and use the Widget: Traveling Salesman with Random Nodes. Students test their heuristic on this widget, keeping a log in their journal of the distance for the path their heuristic finds and the best distance the student finds not using the stated heuristic (i.e. clicking around, or \"brute force\"). \r\n\r\n* Note: Click reset to try different paths on the same level. Click \"New Level\" to generate at new random assortment of nodes.",
