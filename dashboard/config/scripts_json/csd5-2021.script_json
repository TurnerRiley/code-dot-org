They then work in small groups to create a system that can represent any letter in the alphabet using only a single stack of cards. The cards used have one of 6 different possible drawings (6 animals, 6 colors, etc.) and so to represent the entire alphabet students will need to use patterns of multiple cards to represent each letter. Students create messages with their systems and exchange with other groups to ensure the system worked as intended. In the wrap-up discussion the class reviews any pros and cons of the different systems. They discuss commonalities between working systems and recognize that there are many possible solutions to this problem and what's important is that everyone uses the same arbitrary system to communicate.\r\n",

Students then do a short set of challenges using the Pixelation Widget in order to draw black and white images.

Finally this is an opportunity to explore how systems for representing information are created. A \"raw\" image is really hard to represent. The idea to turn an image into a grid of black and white squares significantly simplifies this challenge and makes it into the kind of problem that computer scientists knew how to solve. While the activity in this lesson may feel like just typing 0s and 1s, it actually reveals a lot about how people think about representing information in binary, and what challenges and tradeoffs are created as a result.",

It provides an easy-to-use guided environment for training machine learning models to recognise text, numbers, images, or sounds.*\r\n\t* Machine Learning for Kids is a great option if your students want to work with text samples.
