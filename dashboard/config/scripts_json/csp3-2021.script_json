For example, a label element has choices like \"text alignment\" and \"font family\" while an image has choices like \"fit image\". \r\n\r\n**Levels 3-7:** In these levels, students will learn how specific elements are set up and edited. Level 3 introduces the concept of themes, which control the overall \"look\" of an app. No matter what theme is chosen, students have the ability to override any element's design. \r\n\r\n**Level 8:** Students work from a given image to recreate the user interface for an app. It's ok if their design does not exactly match the sample. The goal is for students to become comfortable setting up a User Interface before the sketch out plans for their own apps in the next lesson."

In other words, it's not their fault! It's hard to do a good job with bad tools!\r\n\r\nWhen running the second discussion push students to think about what a language designed for giving instructions would look like. While specific answers aren't important, you should push them to build on their experiences in the main activity. For example, if they saw that words having two meanings was confusing in the main activity, they should suggest redesigning the language so each word has a single well-understood meaning. \r\n\r\n"

Then move on to the Code Investigation and actually try to answer all the questions for each app. To help you out, however, answers are provided in the \"For Teachers Only\" tab for verified teachers.\n\n**Show code at the front:** If your room allows it, display the code at the front of the room. When students mentions specific lines of code actually scroll to that line and read through it together.\n\n**Discuss specific lines of code:** As you run discussions, model talking about programs by specifically calling out lines of code, as in \"I can see that when the playSound block on line 2 is highlighted the sound plays....\"\n\n**Save modifications for the end:** This lesson can be tight on time. Rather than have students modify the code all at once, you can save modifications for the end of the Code Investigation and have students pick a single app they wish to modify.\n\n**OK to Break Things:** When using the widgets in Units 1 and 2 it's not really possible to \"break things\". That's a little different than how things work in App Lab where it is possible to write code that may not run at all. Encourage students that this is ok. Using blocks makes it easier to avoid errors, and if students need to they can use the version history to set the code back to its original state.\n"

Once it seems all groups have had a chance to do this bring the class together.\n\n**Discuss:** Have students share the results of their discussions with the class. You do not need to use formal vocabulary yet, but make sure all students are seeing the same things.\n\n* Code is running one line at a time.\n* Strings need to go in quotes. Numbers do not need to.\n* Yellow highlighting shows you which line of code is running in either block or text mode.\n* The turtle slider changes the speed at which the code runs. At full speed (all the way to the right) there is no longer any highlighting.\n\n**Level 3:** Run this level in the same way. Have students complete all three prompts and then bring the class together after a few minutes for a discussion.\n\n**Discuss:** Once again have students share the results of their discussions and modifications with the room. Here are some good points to draw out if they don't come up naturally in discussion.\n\n* `console.log` prints text in the Debug Console\n* `setProperty` changes the properties of elements on the screen. These should be familiar from using Design Mode.\n* `console.log` needs one input while `setProperty` needs three\n* Hovering over a block in the toolbox helps you know what kind of information to put in each input.\n\n**Level 4:** Run this level in the same way.

Here are some good points to draw out if they don't come up naturally in discussion.\n\n* `onEvent` makes the program respond to the user. You can add code inside of it that will only run when something happens.\n* Changing the second input changes the type of interaction that will make the code inside the `onEvent` run. \n* Code outside the `onEvent` runs right away. Code inside an `onEvent` will only run when the event happens.\n* Even if code is after an `onEvent`, it will run first if it's outside of any `onEvent`\n\n**Level 5:** Run this level in the same way.

They just help you understand your code.\n\n**Level 6:** Run this level in the same way. Have students complete all three prompts and then bring the class together after a few minutes for a discussion.\n\n**Discuss:** Have students share the results of their discussion and anything else they noticed. Here are good points to draw out.\n\n* Random number chooses a new random number each time, between the high and low value given\n* `onEvent` takes many different event types, not just `\"mouseOver\"` and `\"click\"`.

It's important that others can understand our code, so write your code clearly using the practices we discussed and comments.  \r\n\r\nNot all programming environments support comments, so other forms of documentation may be important like keeping a separate document with information about your program. The key takeaway here, is no matter what the format, comments and documentation are important!\r\n\r\nAs you grow in your programming skills, you will start to appreciate how valuable comments can be. You don't have to wait until a program is complete to write the comments. You should be doing this as you develop the project. There will be opportunities to write comments called out in the App project you are currently working on.",
